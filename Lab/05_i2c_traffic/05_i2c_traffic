In this part, we used the code from Lab 1. 
We obsereved the I2C signals, i.e., SCL and SDA, on a CRO.
We used two separate channels by connecting black probes to the ground pin and red probes to the individual pins, i.e. SCL and SDA.
Adjested the settings of the CRO to get a clear trace of the signals.
