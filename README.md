##	2.  An outline of what you plan to build, and why you think itâ€™s cool.

o	What are we going to do: We are planning to use LEDs arranged in specific patterns to indicate in which direction a car is going to take turn (left or right).

o	Why do we want to do this: This idea has practical application and would be fun implementing.
